# Algorithms for competitive programming

This repository contains C++ implementations for common algorithms found in competitive programming tasks.
Some competitions allow prewritten code to be used, others only allow printed versions.

Files may contain some important algorithm, utility functions, or multiple algorithms in one general category.
The code is intended to be short to reduce typing, and general enough to be used in many tasks
with minimal modification.
